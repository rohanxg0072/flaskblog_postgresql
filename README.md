# postresql-quickforms-flaskblog
Personal blog created using Flask and following a Corey Schafer Youtube tutorial series. 
Forms implemented using WTF Bootstrap Quick Forms instead of manually; posted on github since I could not find a good tutorial with complete source code for WTF Bootstrap Quick Forms.
Database also implemented using postgresql instead of sqlite
Deployed at https://postgresflaskblog.herokuapp.com/. config.json (used to store private information and opened in config.py) not uploaded but needed to run application. 
Application allows users to create accounts which can create, update and delete their own posts, as well as view other users' posts. 
Users can also change their username, email, profile picture and password, as well as reset their password by requesting a password change through email.
